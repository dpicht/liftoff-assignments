# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In today's world, people are ordering from food delivery services more than ever. My app, which has yet to be named, will
provide a platform where the user can enter their zip code or the name of a restaurant. Once that information has been submitted,
the app will display which apps can be used to deliver that specific food, for example DoorDash or Postmates. This will be useful
as many restaurants are exclusive to a certain app, meaning they can not be found on all delivery services. If they are on 
multiple services, it would also be useful to display the delivery charges for each service so that the user can compare and
decide which service they want to use.
### Features
Search Feature: Will allow the user to search for a specific restaurant. There will also be an option to search by location.
User Login Feature: If the user wants to make an account, they will be able to log in to set up a profile. This will not be a requirement
to use the app.
Comment Feature: User will have the option to comment on their experience for each restaurant, and each delivery service.
### Technologies
I would like to use JavaScript/ Angular for the front end of the project. I may also have to incorporate Java and SQL, because
the restaurants and delivery services could be stored in a SQL table. If the entire project can be done using Java and SQL, then
it seems like JavaScript and Angular may complicate everything.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to incorporate data from an existing source, as the search feature will have to search through the
restaurants and delivery services available.
